## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of UXUY Connect which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most UXUY Connect users.
- **List some other applications where this enhancement exists.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to UXUY Connect? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues](https://github.com/uxuyconnect/uxuyconnect/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/uxuyconnect/uxuyconnect/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain UXUY Connect's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible UXUY Connect
- Enable a sustainable system for UXUY Connect's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  * üêß `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
  * üçé `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
  * üèÅ `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
  * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
  * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
  * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
  * üëï `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
  ```
* Place requires in the following order:
  * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
  * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
  * Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)
  * Instance methods and properties

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
  * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
  * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`
  * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
