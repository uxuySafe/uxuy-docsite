# Getting Started

Before creating a UXUY Gift, you need to:

1.  Download the Telegram app and set up your UXUY Telegram Wallet.
2.  If the token and blockchain you choose for sending the Gift are part of the supported default options, you can skip this step. However, if blockchain and token are not in the default options, you will need to use the token management feature to add the desired token and its corresponding blockchain.
3.  Ensure you have sufficient funds for the Gift and the corresponding native tokens to cover the gas fees.

Once these preparations are complete, you‚Äôre ready to create a UXUY Gift. Let‚Äôs get started!
